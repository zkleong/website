**Overcomplicating My Website (Then Got It Done with Quarto)**

Finally, I have a working website! This has been a [Hacky Hour](https://numbat.space/hacky-hour/) project of mine throughout the semester. It seems easy at first—but I got a bit ambitious. I thought, “I want to design it exactly the way I want to,” and went down a whole rabbit hole... only to realise, I’m not a web developer.

While I definitely learned a lot along the way, what I needed for my website could’ve been done way more easily using the templates that already exist. I wish I had known that earlier. The first few weeks were basically me messing around, trying to get Claude to design a beautiful layout for me. 

Eventually, I just gave in (gratefully) and settled on the ready-made Quarto website template.

**Big shoutout to the NUMBAT team, particularly the HACKY HOUR group**

This whole thing wouldn’t have been possible without the help from the [NUMBAT](https://numbat.space/) team at Monash. I’m incredibly new to all this, and they’ve been so generous—helping me with all the little things I needed to get this site functioning. It would’ve been so much harder (and way more time-consuming) without them.

**Still a bit bare, but it’s a start**

Right now, the website still looks pretty empty, but I’ll be filling it up over time. Most of my energy so far has gone into building the CV page. Even just wrapping my head around how a Quarto website works took up a surprising amount of time. What really helped, though, was the amazing community of people who’ve put in the effort to make this process more beginner-friendly.

Here are a few of the resources I used (aside from the wonderful humans from Hacky Hour):

1) [Posit PBC on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@PositPBC) – Their videos on building personal websites with Quarto were my main reference point and helped me get started. 

2) [The Quarto GitHub repository](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web) – It was super useful to see how they built their own website.

3) [Publishing both HTML and PDF with Quarto by Cynthia Huang](https://www.cynthiahqy.com/posts/cv-html-pdf/) – This was a game changer for building my CV page. It showed me how to create a clean HTML page and render a PDF version alongside it.

**Feeling excited (and just slightly overwhelmed)**

Now that the site is up, I suddenly feel like there’s so much I can do with it—so many ideas I could add, projects to showcase, things to try out. It’s exciting! Of course, time and energy are limited, so we’ll see how much I can actually get done… but I’m hopeful.

If you’re thinking of building your own site: go for it. Keep it simple. Don’t overthink it (like I did). Use the templates. Ask for help. It really does get better the more you chip away at it.

**And just like that... I think this is my first blog post on the site. Wild.**
