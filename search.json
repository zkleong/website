    "text": "Overcomplicating My Website (Then Got It Done with Quarto)\nFinally, I have a working website! This has been a Hacky Hour project of mine throughout the semester. It seems easy at first—but I got a bit ambitious. I thought, “I want to design it exactly the way I want to,” and went down a whole rabbit hole… only to realise, I’m not a web developer.\nWhile I definitely learned a lot along the way, what I needed for my website could’ve been done way more easily using the templates that already exist. I wish I had known that earlier. The first few weeks were basically me messing around, trying to get Claude to design a beautiful layout for me.\nEventually, I just gave in (gratefully) and settled on the ready-made Quarto website template.\nBig shoutout to the NUMBAT team, particularly the HACKY HOUR group\nThis whole thing wouldn’t have been possible without the help from the NUMBAT team at Monash. I’m incredibly new to all this, and they’ve been so generous—helping me with all the little things I needed to get this site functioning. It would’ve been so much harder (and way more time-consuming) without them.\nStill a bit bare, but it’s a start\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomepage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCV-html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCV-pdf\n\n\n\n\n\nRight now, the website still looks pretty empty, but I’ll be filling it up over time. Most of my energy so far has gone into building the CV page. Even just wrapping my head around how a Quarto website works took up a surprising amount of time. What really helped, though, was the amazing community of people who’ve put in the effort to make this process more beginner-friendly.\nHere are a few of the resources I used (aside from the wonderful humans from Hacky Hour):\n\nPosit PBC on Youtube – Their videos on building personal websites with Quarto were my main reference point and helped me get started.\nThe Quarto GitHub repository – It was super useful to see how they built their own website.\nPublishing both HTML and PDF with Quarto by Cynthia Huang – This was a game changer for building my CV page. It showed me how to create a clean HTML page and render a PDF version alongside it.\n\nFeeling excited (and just slightly overwhelmed)\nNow that the site is up, I suddenly feel like there’s so much I can do with it—so many ideas I could add, projects to showcase, things to try out. It’s exciting! Of course, time and energy are limited, so we’ll see how much I can actually get done… but I’m hopeful.\nIf you’re thinking of building your own site: go for it. Keep it simple. Don’t overthink it (like I did). Use the templates. Ask for help. It really does get better the more you chip away at it.\nAnd just like that… I think this is my first blog post on the site. Wild."

My research looks at multidrug-resistant organisms, using data to explore issues related to intensive care and hospital settings.\nWhat drew me to this area is the reminder that behind every data point is a real person—someone who was seriously unwell. That perspective keeps me grounded and gives purpose to the work I do.\nI’m especially interested in healthcare analytics, population health, and statistical and mathematical modeling—and I’m hoping to grow further in these areas. On the side, I’ve also been working on tools to make data cleaning more efficient, especially for messy datasets with entry errors.\nOther human interests: 🚶‍♂️🎵🎤🏔️🎮🏖️📺\nEmail: zhuan.leong@monash.edu"
